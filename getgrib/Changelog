Version 1.2-7
=============
Function ``bilinear'' still requires a SpatialPointsDataFrame
as input with a column called ``statnr''. This ``statnr'' can
now also be of type factor or character. If numeric, the resulting
column mames will be of type ``station_XXX'', else the character
string or level name from the statnr column.

Version 1.2-6
=============
Added ``in = NULL;`` to set the file handler pointer to ``NULL``
which led to a ulim porblem when processing 1000+ grib files.
